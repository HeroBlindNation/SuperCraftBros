# SuperCraftBros Reloaded

##### Double0negative's SuperCraftBros plugin, reloaded! Supports: Bukkit/Spigot 1.8.7+

## What is it?

Originally based off the classic Nintendo game, SuperCraftBros is a class-based PvP game where players fight to be the last one alive. This reloaded version offers a much more fleshed-out edition than Double0negative's original code and our version also comes with the promise of support for current Minecraft releases.
